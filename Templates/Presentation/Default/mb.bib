abstract = {In the last few years it has been proposed a one-dimensional factorization of the fermion determinant in lattice QCD with Wilson-type fermions that leads to a block-local action of the auxiliary bosonic fields. Here we propose a four-dimensional generalization of this factorization. Possible applications are more efficient parallelizations of Monte Carlo algorithms and codes, master field simulations, and multi-level integration.}
