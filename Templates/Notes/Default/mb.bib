@article{Bruno_2023,
	abstract = {Observables in particle physics and specifically in lattice QCD calculations are often extracted from fits. Standard $\chi^2$ tests require a reliable determination of the covariance matrix and its inverse from correlated and auto-correlated data, a challenging task often leading to close-to-singular estimates. These motivate modifications of the definition of $\chi^2$ such as uncorrelated fits. We show how the goodness-of-fit measured by their p-value can still be estimated robustly for a broad class of such fits.},

@article{Davier_2006,
	abstract = {Hadronic tau decays represent a clean laboratory for the precise study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Observables (sum rules) based on the spectral functions of hadronic tau decays can be related to QCD quark-level calculations to determine fundamental quantities like the strong coupling constant, parameters of the chiral Lagrangian, |V_us|, the mass of the strange quark, and to simultaneously test the concept of quark-hadron duality. Using the best available measurements and a revisited analysis of the theoretical framework, the value alpha_s(m_tau) = 0.345 +- 0.004[exp] +- 0.009[theo] is obtained. Taken together with the determination of alpha_s(m_Z) from the global electroweak fit, this result leads to the most accurate test of asymptotic freedom: the value of the logarithmic slope of 1/alpha_s(s) is found to agree with QCD at a precision of 4%. In another approach, the tau spectral functions can be used to determine hadronic quantities that, due to the nonperturbative nature of long-distance QCD, cannot be computed from first principles. An example for this is the contribution from hadronic vacuum polarization to loop-dominated processes like the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. This article reviews the measurements of nonstrange and strange tau spectral functions and their phenomenological applications.},

@article{Hansen_2019,
	abstract = {Hadronic spectral densities are important quantities whose non-perturbative knowledge allows for calculating phenomenologically relevant observables, such as inclusive hadronic cross-sections and non-leptonic decay-rates. The extraction of spectral densities from lattice correlators is a notoriously difficult problem because lattice simulations are performed in Euclidean time and lattice data are unavoidably affected by statistical and systematic uncertainties. In this paper we present a new method for extracting hadronic spectral densities from lattice correlators. The method allows for choosing a smearing function at the beginning of the procedure and it provides results for the spectral densities smeared with this function together with reliable estimates of the associated uncertainties. The same smearing function can be used in the analysis of correlators obtained on different volumes, such that the infinite volume limit can be studied in a consistent way. While the method is described by using the language of lattice simulations, in reality it is completely general and can profitably be used to cope with inverse problems arising in different fields of research.},

@article{Bulava_2023,
	abstract = {A recently re-discovered variant of the Backus-Gilbert algorithm for spectral reconstruction enables the controlled determination of smeared spectral densities from lattice field theory correlation functions. A particular advantage of this approach is the \emph{a priori} specification of the kernel with which the underlying spectral density is smeared, allowing for variation of its peak position, smearing width, and functional form. If the unsmeared spectral density is sufficiently smooth in the neighborhood of a particular energy, it can be obtained from an extrapolation to zero smearing-kernel width at fixed peak position. A natural application for this approach is scattering processes summed over all hadronic final states. As a proof-of-principle test, an inclusive rate is computed in the two-dimensional O(3) sigma model from a two-point correlation function of conserved currents. The results at finite and zero smearing radius are in good agreement with the known analytic form up to energies at which 40-particle states contribute, and are sensitive to the 4-particle contribution to the inclusive rate. The straight-forward adaptation to compute the $R$-ratio in lattice QCD from two-point functions of the electromagnetic current is briefly discussed.},

@article{DelDebbio_2022,
	abstract = {We present a lattice study of the $SU(4)$ gauge theory with two Dirac fermions in the fundamental and two in the two-index antisymmetric representation, a model close to a theory of partial compositeness. Focus of this work are the methodologies behind the computation of the spectrum and the extrapolation of the chiral point for a theory with matter in multiple representations. While being still technical, this study provides important steps towards a non-perturbative understanding of the spectrum of theories of partial compositeness, which present a richer dynamics compared to single-representation theories. The multi-representation features are studied first in perturbation theory, and then non-perturbatively by adopting a dual outlook on lattice data through a joint analysis of time-momentum correlation functions and smeared spectral densities.},

[1], that allows to extract smeared spectral densities from Euclidean correlators, we compute the $R$-ratio convoluted with Gaussian smearing kernels of widths of about $600$ MeV and central energies from $220$ MeV up to $2.5$ GeV. Our theoretical results are compared with the corresponding quantities obtained by smearing the KNT19 compilation [2] of $R$-ratio experimental measurements with the same Gaussian kernels and, in the region around the $\rho$-resonance peak, a tension of about three standard deviations is observed.},
